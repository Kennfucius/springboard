# Capstone 1 - Practice Problem Recommendation Engine

The goal of this project is to build a recommendation engine to recommend practice problems to students. The first part is to predict the number of attempts a student will require to solve a given problem. The idea is that if we can accurately predict the number of attempts a student will require to solve a problem, we can recommend a problem that is not too easy and not too hard (takes too many attempts). The data provided by [Analytics Vidhya](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-recommendation-engine/) comes in three separate tables. The details of each dataset is described below.
